Description: This package allows to estimate missing values in DNA methylation data. methyLImp method is based on linear regression since methylation levels show a high degree of inter-sample correlation. Implementation is parallelised over chromosomes since probes on different chromosomes are usually independent. Mini-batch approach to reduce the runtime in case of large number of samples is available.
